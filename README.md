# TG-NPDCL EV Charging Stations Consumption Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **EV charging station consumption data** from the **Telangana Northern Power Distribution Company Limited (TG-NPDCL)** for the year **2024**. The data, obtained from public monthly reports, was processed using Python to extract insights on **electricity consumption, high and low-demand regions, and seasonal trends**.

## 📂 Dataset Information
# TG-NPDCL EV Charging Stations Consumption Data

This dataset has been downloaded from the [Telangana Open Data Portal](https://data.telangana.gov.in/dataset/tg-npdcl-ev-charging-stations-consumption-data). It contains information on electricity consumption at electric vehicle (EV) charging stations under **TG-NPDCL (Telangana Northern Power Distribution Company Limited)**.

The data consists of monthly, I have **merged monthly reports** from January 2024 to December 2024 using python.
The key columns include:
- **Circle, Division, Subdivision, Section, Area** – Location-based attributes.
- **Catdesc, Catcode** – Consumer category details.
- **Totservices** – Total number of EV charging services.
- **Billdservices** – Number of billed charging services.
- **Units** – Electricity consumption (kWh).
- **Load** – Load capacity (kW).

## 🚀 Analysis
- 📊 **Monthly Electricity Consumption Trends**
